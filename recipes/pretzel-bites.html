        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1½ cups water</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>2½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 quarts cold water</li>
            <li>½ cup baking soda</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place 1½ cups water, butter, brown sugar, yeast, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the hook attachment. Mix until well combined. Let sit for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn mixer on low speed and add 4 cups flour, 1 cup at a time. Add additional ½ cup flour if dough appears sticky. Increase speed to medium and knead until dough is smooth and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, 4 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle in more flour if dough still seems a little tacky.</li>
            <li>Oil a large mixing bowl. Add the ball of dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a sheet pan with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Bring 3 quarts water to a boil in a large saucepan. Slowly add baking soda and return to a boil.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, remove dough from the bowl, flatten into a disc shape, and cut into 8 wedges. Roll each wedge into a 24-inch rope. Cut each rope into 1-inch pieces.</li>
            <li>Drop batches of dough pieces into the boiling water for about 35 seconds. Remove to the prepared sheet pan. Beat egg with 1 tablespoon water; brush over the tops of each boiled dough piece. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 14 to 16 minutes. Cool slightly before saving.</li>
        </ol>
